# Tasks - Simple PHP To-Do List

## Overview

Tasks is a simple PHP project designed to refresh basic PHP concepts through a minimal to-do list application. This
project does not include authentication or a database. It consists of a main page (`index.php`), additional PHP files to
manage task deletion and status updates, and some frontend resources (CSS and JavaScript).

## Features

- Add tasks with a unique ID generated using `time()`.
- Mark tasks as completed or not completed (boolean `isDone` value).
- Delete tasks.
- Store tasks in a JSON file (`tasks.json`).

## Project Structure

```plaintext
/tasks
â”‚â”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.json          # Stores tasks in JSON format
â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ includes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ footer.php         # Footer template
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ head.php           # Head section template
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ header.php         # Header template
â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ style.css      # Stylesheet
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js       # JavaScript file
â”‚
â”‚â”€â”€ .gitignore             # Git ignore file
â”‚â”€â”€ delete_task.php        # Handles task deletion
â”‚â”€â”€ edit_task.php          # Handles task updates
â”‚â”€â”€ index.php              # Main page displaying tasks
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md              # Project documentation
```

## How It Works

1. **Adding Tasks**: Tasks are created and assigned a unique ID using the `time()` function and stored in `tasks.json`.
2. **Marking as Done/Not Done**: Clicking an action button updates the `isDone` boolean value.
3. **Deleting Tasks**: A delete option removes tasks from the JSON file.
